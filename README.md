# project-ideas
A list of project ideas for when I need a new coding project to work on.
- OCR Tool to Decode Dancing Men Cipher (Software Dev)
- Autosolver for ciphertext (Tries a cipher-text against a bunch of different kinds of ciphers)
- OCT Tool to recognize the Loomis money truck out my window and track when it shows up (Eye catching)

- Use Github REST API to automatically fill the portfolio section of my website with projects. The could would only get pinned repo's from my profile and I could pin repo's I want in my portfolio. The code would pull the repo-name, repo-description, repo-langauges, and how many stars and forks each repo has. This would make updating the site with new repo's obsolete, as this process would now be automated.

- <del> Add a map with the trucks current location on it for my food truck project. https://github.com/AidanSpeakss/foodtrucks </del>
- <del> Add a menu section to my food truck project. https://github.com/AidanSpeakss/foodtrucks </del>
-  Make a super-simple Node.JS CMS for updating the location of your food truck (which then updates the map), updating your hours/locations, your menu, and your branding. https://github.com/AidanSpeakss/foodtrucks
-  Modify the "Streamer Mode for Firefox extension" and give it the ability to add fake dm's in Twitter. Could be used to show people, how easy it is to fake video's of DM's, creating distrust in videos as a form of social proof. But in a way, by making this sort of tool, it would release the cat from the bag, allowing users to abuse it for nefarious and malicous purposes. I have serious moral and ethical questions to answer, before making such a tool.
-  Create a tool that automatically takes images from someone's Facebook, Instagram, etc and runs them through an AI age detection tool to get an estimated age of the user (https://age.toolpie.com/)
-  Readd ability to see how much you've spent on Amazon (lifetime and specific year) using browser extension
