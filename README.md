# project-ideas
A list of project ideas for when I need a new coding project to work on.
- OCR Tool to Decode Dancing Men Cipher (Software Dev)
- Autosolver for ciphertext (Tries a cipher-text against a bunch of different kinds of ciphers)
- OCT Tool to recognize the Loomis money truck out my window and track when it shows up (Eye catching)
