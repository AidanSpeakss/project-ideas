# project-ideas
A list of project ideas for when I need a new coding project to work on.
- OCR Tool to Decode Dancing Men Cipher (Software Dev)
- Autosolver for ciphertext (Tries a cipher-text against a bunch of different kinds of ciphers)
- OCT Tool to recognize the Loomis money truck out my window and track when it shows up (Eye catching)

- Use Github REST API to automatically fill the portfolio section of my website with projects. The could would only get pinned repo's from my profile and I could pin repo's I want in my portfolio. The code would pull the repo-name, repo-description, repo-langauges, and how many stars and forks each repo has. This would make updating the site with new repo's obsolete, as this process would now be automated.
